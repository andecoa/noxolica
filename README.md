I've been in the software development industry for 4+ years doing full stack and internal tooling development. I'm at a point where I've produced software that uses message queues, caching servers, pub/sub patterns, and machine learning in a commercial setting. Based in Vancouver, Canada.

- **Roast my resume:** [tell me feedback](https://flowcv.io/resume/feedback/dAVvUzcKnpPT)
- **Next goal:** AWS developer certification.
- **Blindspot being addressed:** testing APIs with Jest.
- **Fun fact:** I once tried to create an alternative healthcare startup but failed because startups are damn hard to do.
